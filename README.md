# No-Knock Protection: a simple computer vision doorbell (WIP)
Do you often forget to check your doorfront for packages? Do you need to be notified when your friends arrive at your door? Do your parents enter your room without knocking?  
If you answered yes to any of the above, No Knock Protection is designed to help mitigate those troubles. This demo will showcase a simple functionality of notifying the user through a text message once the camera has sensed something moving towards the door.
